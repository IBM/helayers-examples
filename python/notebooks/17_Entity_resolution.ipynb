    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates the Privacy Preserving Record Linkage (PPRL) Protocol between two parties, called Alice and Bob.\n",
    "Alice and Bob both have their own DB with ~500,000 private records, and the objective here is for the two sides to learn which of their records match similar records in the other side's DB but nothing else (beyond also incidentally the number of records in the other side's DB). So for example, they don't get to learn anything about the non-similar records of the other side, nor the similar but possibly different fields of the identified similar record of the other side.\n",
    "\n",
    "The protocol is similar to the Private-Set-Intersection (PSI) protocol, except that it allowes for similarities rather than requiring exact equivalence of the reported candidate pairs. The similarity of the records is measured in terms of the Jaccard similarity index of the two records (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) and uses min-hashing to estimate this similarity measure. For performance reasons, the Record-Linkage algorithm is statistical so that matched pairs of records probably have a high Jaccard similarity index.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the datasets used below Alice's Datbase includes RecordA and Bob's Database includes RecordB.\n",
    "These records are not identical but their close similarity indicates that the very probably refer to the same entity\n",
    "as reported in the final match report at the end of the demo below.\n",

    " ## Step 2. Define the Record-Linkage rules\n",
    " Here we define the rules by which we will consider two records as linked.\n",

    "  RL_RULE_SIMILAR or RL_RULE_NONE (which is the default rule type).\n",
    "    - Fields with RL_RULE_EQUAL rule type implies that two records to be\n",

    "    - Fields with RL_RULE_SIMILAR rule type implies that records to be\n",

    "      simmilarity. We can also optionaly set the weight and size of shingles\n",
    "      generated for every such field.\n",
    "    - Fields with RL_RULE_NONE rule type are not taken into account in the record\n",
    "      linkage process\n",
    "  \n",
    "  For two records to be considered linked, ALL the conditions in the specific\n",
    "  rule must apply. For example, if first_name is set to RL_RULE_EQUAL and\n",
    "  address_location is set to RL_RULE_SIMILAR then two records considered\n",
    "  linked if their first_name content is equal AND their address_location\n",
    "  content is similar.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  We can run the protocol with a number of rules iteratively. Two records are\n",
    "  considered linked if at least one of the rules applies for them. The order\n",
    "  of the rules matter - After a record has been matched, it will not be\n",
    "  considered as a candidate at the following iterations.\n",
    "  Thus, defining multiple rules is not only useful for defining separate match \n",
    "  conditions, but can also be used to optimize the performance of the matching \n",
    "  process by placing fast-to-compute rules before slow-to-compute rules.\n",
    "  For example, testing for field equality is generally faster than testing for \n",
    "  field similarity, rule1 of this example is faster to   compute than rule2. \n",
    "  Rule1 is computed before rule2, so all the \"easy\" matches are first carried out \n",
