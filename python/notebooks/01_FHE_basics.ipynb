    "\n",
    "A `Context` is the main HE object. It receives the configuration parameters, and initializes all the required mathemtical constructs. It also generates the keys and supplies various services. In pyhelayers it also stores the keys.\n",

    "Configuring the context correctly is key to achieving the desired results when using homomorphic encryption, and its parameters depend on the nature of the problem to be solved.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the example below we create a requirement object and define the security level, integer precision, fractional precision, multiplication depth (how many times the ciphertext can be multiplied), and ciphertext slot size, `num_slots`. A slot defines how large each ciphertext can be. This ciphertext has 8192 slots, i.e., it can hold 8192 numbers.\n",

    "\n",
    "Once the `Context` has been created and initialized, we can use it for different operations. Next we will showcase basic mathematical operations done using `pyhelayers`. Note that while carrying out these operations the data always remains encrypted and never gets decrypted even during computation.\n",

    "### Encoding, decoding, encrypting and decrypting\n",
    "In HE, the encryption process from the user perspective actually involves two steps: encoding and then encrypting. Similarly the decryption involves decrypting and then decoding.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The encoding step takes the input data and **encodes** it into plaintext form that can then be **encrypted** into the ciphertext using the public key. The homomorphic computations are done by manipulating the ciphertexts, and when this is done, the holder of the secret key can **decrypt** the resulting ciphertext back into plaintext form. Finally, the plaintext should be **decoded** in order to extract the resulting values (with possible noise).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "> X + Y =~ decode( decrypt( encrypt( encode(X)) + encrypt(encode(Y)) ) )\n",
    "\n",
    "For example in some schemes (like CKKS) the input data is a vector of values that need to be encrypted, the encoded plaintext is a polynomial, and the ciphertext is a pair of polynomials.\n",
    "\n",
    "The role of the encoding step is just to represent the input data in a form that can be encrypted in the encryption step, and it does not provide any security. In other words, anyone may decode the plaintext to reveal the encoded values, without requiring any secret key for this decoding operation. All the security of the scheme comes from the encryption step, which encrypts the encoded plaintext into the ciphertext in such a way that it can only be efficiently decrypted by using the secret key.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In this example a ciphertext is created from the vector `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]`.  Using an instance of `Encoder` named `encoder`, `v1` is encrypted and stored in `c1` by calling `encoder.encode_encrypt(v1)`.  It is then decrypted with `encoder.decrypt_decode_double(c1)` and stored in `d1`.  \n",
