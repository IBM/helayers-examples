    "(NOTE: to get help on pyhelayers or any of its classes type `help(pyhelayers)` or `help(pyhelayers.HeContext)`, etc...)\n",
    "\n",
    "An HeContext is the main object for accessing the underlying FHE encryption scheme. Once initialized, it generates the keys and all the other data structures required for working with FHE. It is an abstract class with several different concrete implementations, each for a different FHE scheme, or a different open source library implementing these schemes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use the `MockupContext`, which is a non-encrypted implementation for quick tests. However, HELayer's APIs abstract away the underlying details, so the same code can later be switched to work with a real FHE scheme by simply changing the HeContext creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "An `HeContext` is initialized with an `HeConfigRequirement` object that defines our requirements from the FHE scheme: e.g., the number of slots in a ciphertext, the maximal multiplication depth of the evaluated circuit, or the security level. For demonstration purposes, we use ciphertexts with only 8 slots. To this end, we create a configuration using the `insecure` method, which explicitly states that the security level is 0. This allows us to use the Mockup implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the FHE basics demo for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a `TTEncoder` object is responsible for encrypting and decrypting tensors. How it works is the central focus of these demos. Note that in FHE there's also an encoding step which is a preprocessing step before encryption, and similarly a postprocessing decoding step after decryption. Hence, the encryption and decryption methods are called `encode_encrypt` and `decrypt_decode`. In some advanced scenarios, it is useful to perform these steps separately."
